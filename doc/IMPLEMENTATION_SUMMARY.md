# Gradle Configuration Inspection - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the Gradle configuration inspection feature for the GeoGebra workspace.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Convention Plugin (`inspect-gradle-config.gradle.kts`)

A new Gradle convention plugin was created at:
`source/build-logic/convention/src/main/kotlin/inspect-gradle-config.gradle.kts`

This plugin provides four inspection tasks:

#### `inspectConfig`
Displays comprehensive workspace configuration including:
- Root project details (name, directory, Gradle version)
- Included builds (composite build structure)
- Root project properties
- Applied plugins
- Available inspection commands

**Usage:**
```bash
./gradlew inspectConfig
```

#### `inspectProjects`
Lists all projects in the workspace, showing:
- Root project name
- All included builds with their locations
- Tips for inspecting specific projects

**Usage:**
```bash
./gradlew inspectProjects
```

#### `inspectPlugins`
Shows detailed information about plugins applied to the root project:
- Plugin simple names
- Full class names

**Usage:**
```bash
./gradlew inspectPlugins
```

#### `inspectSettings`
Displays Gradle settings configuration:
- Root project name
- Settings directory
- Included builds
- Configuration file locations

**Usage:**
```bash
./gradlew inspectSettings
```

### 2. Helper Script (`inspect-gradle.sh`)

A bash script for convenient access to inspection features:
- Automatically uses offline mode when possible
- Provides a simplified command-line interface
- Falls back gracefully if offline mode fails

**Usage:**
```bash
./inspect-gradle.sh config    # Show workspace configuration
./inspect-gradle.sh projects  # List all projects
./inspect-gradle.sh plugins   # Show applied plugins
./inspect-gradle.sh settings  # Show settings configuration
./inspect-gradle.sh help      # Show help message
```

### 3. Init Script (`inspect-config.gradle`)

A Gradle init script for advanced inspection without triggering full project configuration:
- Executes at project load time
- Provides comprehensive workspace information
- Useful when the build has configuration issues

**Usage:**
```bash
./gradlew --init-script inspect-config.gradle inspectWorkspace
```

### 4. Documentation

#### `doc/GRADLE_INSPECTION.md`
Comprehensive documentation covering:
- All inspection tools and their usage
- Understanding the build structure
- Troubleshooting guide
- Standard Gradle commands for inspection
- How to add new inspection features

#### Updated `README.md`
Added a new section on "Inspecting Gradle Configuration" with quick-start commands.

### 5. Configuration Fixes

Fixed several pre-existing issues that prevented inspection tasks from working:

#### Fixed in `source/shared/settings.gradle.kts`:
- Commented out reference to missing `openrewrite` build

#### Fixed in `source/shared/common-jre/build.gradle.kts`:
- Moved configuration-time dependency resolution into task execution phase
- Wrapped file resolution in `doFirst` block of `jacocoTestReport` task

#### Fixed in `source/desktop/desktop/build.gradle.kts`:
- Converted configuration-time JOGL native JAR copying into a proper task (`copyJoglNatives`)
- Made `run` task depend on the new task
- Eliminated eager configuration resolution

### 6. Build Infrastructure

#### Added `.gitignore`:
Created root-level `.gitignore` to prevent build artifacts from being committed:
- `.gradle/` directories
- `build/` directories
- IDE files

## Testing

All inspection tasks were tested and verified to work correctly:

✅ `./gradlew inspectConfig` - Successfully displays workspace information
✅ `./gradlew inspectProjects` - Successfully lists all projects
✅ `./gradlew inspectPlugins` - Successfully shows applied plugins
✅ `./gradlew inspectSettings` - Successfully shows settings info
✅ `./inspect-gradle.sh` - All commands work correctly
✅ Init script inspection - Works without triggering full configuration

## Benefits

1. **Easy Workspace Understanding**: Developers can quickly understand the Gradle build structure
2. **Debugging Support**: Helps diagnose build configuration issues
3. **Onboarding**: New developers can explore the workspace without full documentation
4. **Configuration Validation**: Verify settings and plugins are correctly applied
5. **CI/CD Integration**: Can be used in automation to verify build configuration

## Example Output

### `./gradlew inspectProjects`
```
=== Workspace Projects ===
Root: geogebra

=== Included Builds ===

Build: build-logic
  Location: /home/runner/work/geogebra/geogebra/source/build-logic

Build: shared
  Location: /home/runner/work/geogebra/geogebra/source/shared

Build: desktop
  Location: /home/runner/work/geogebra/geogebra/source/desktop

Build: web
  Location: /home/runner/work/geogebra/geogebra/source/web
```

### `./gradlew inspectPlugins`
```
=== Root Project Plugins ===
Project: geogebra

- HelpTasksPlugin_Decorated
- IdeaPlugin_Decorated
- IdeaExtPlugin
- IdeaConventionsPlugin
- InspectGradleConfigPlugin
```

## Files Changed

### New Files:
- `.gitignore`
- `inspect-gradle.sh` (executable script)
- `inspect-config.gradle` (init script)
- `source/build-logic/convention/src/main/kotlin/inspect-gradle-config.gradle.kts`
- `doc/GRADLE_INSPECTION.md`
- `doc/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` (this file)

### Modified Files:
- `README.md` - Added inspection documentation
- `build.gradle.kts` - Applied `inspect-gradle-config` plugin
- `source/shared/settings.gradle.kts` - Commented out openrewrite reference
- `source/shared/common-jre/build.gradle.kts` - Fixed configuration-time resolution
- `source/desktop/desktop/build.gradle.kts` - Fixed configuration-time resolution

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:

1. **Dependency Inspection**: Add tasks to inspect dependencies across all projects
2. **Task Analysis**: Show task dependencies and execution graphs
3. **Build Performance**: Add timing and performance metrics
4. **Configuration Cache**: Inspect configuration cache status
5. **Plugin Versions**: Show versions of applied plugins
6. **Custom Properties**: Filter and display custom project properties
7. **Build Scan Integration**: Link to build scan results

## Notes

- The implementation follows Gradle best practices
- All inspection tasks avoid triggering unnecessary configuration
- The solution is extensible and maintainable
- Documentation is comprehensive and user-friendly
- No existing functionality was broken
